# This is for any designers to put their ideas here
Idea 1:  The game would seem like a totally normal game (maybe a stereotypical 2D platformer). But we would scatter secrets across the levels, from here we could go 2 different paths:  
  1. We make it so the when the player interacts with the secrets he's met with unique stages (we could either make the stages a unique take on the 2D platformer or completley different games). We could then add secrets within these levels which make a complete story and if the player completes all these secret stages he gets an alternate ending (similiar to shipwrecked 64).
  2a. We could make it that the player has to find all the secrets throughout the levels to reach a completley different game (the actual game).
  2b. We could make it that the player has to find 1 secret (maybe via puzzle solving or collecting clue around the levels to help find the secret) to find the "actual game".

Idea 2:
  1:
    Doom based level with the letters scattered randomly over the place, the player can switch from a portal gun (hopefully a breadstick or pizza) to a normal gun and shoot these letters to get points, once this is finished, a secret will be added
